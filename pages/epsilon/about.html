          <strong>Epsilon Fantasy Football was established in 2020</strong> as
          an offshoot of a larger fraternity league, falling under new
          leadership while retaining many members from the original fraternity
          league. Epsilon takes its name from Sigma Phi Epsilon, honoring its
          fraternity origins, while also nodding to the mathematical symbol ε,
          representing a positive but indeterminate amount, in recognition of
          dear friends who were not brothers but have become equally valued
          members of the community.<br /><br />
          <strong
            >Epsilon serves as a casual redraft league where long-time friends
            compete annually</strong
          >, with rosters reset and drafted from scratch each season. The league
          is free-to-play but awards the victors a traveling trophy, serving as
          a tangible artifact that passes from champion to champion. More
          recently, members have begun gathering once a year for an in-person
          retreat and offline draft, adding to the traditions of the league.
          This combination of history, friendship, and accessible competition
          has made Epsilon a cherished fantasy league.
