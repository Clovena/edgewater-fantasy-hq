The franchise is inspired by the fictional underwater world of Spongebob Squarepants, with the \"Stars\" nickname honoring Patrick Star himself. Bikini Bottom has established itself as the league's most aggressive buyer, consistently trading draft capital for established talent and building perennial strength at wide receiver. The front office operates with a level-headed approach that capitalizes on opportunity, going all-in when championship windows open. This calculated aggression has made the Stars the most decorated franchise in Sixth City history, setting the standard for sustained excellence in the House of Commons Conference."

The franchise draws its identity from the province's notoriously harsh Atlantic winds that batter the eastern coast, while the caribou logo honors Newfoundland and Labrador's iconic woodland caribou. The Blowers operate with a frenetic energy on the trade block, constantly wheeling and dealing in pursuit of the next big thing. While the front office demonstrates a keen eye for talent, their approach lacks long-term vision, occasionally resulting in moves that hinder rather than help. Newfoundland embraces an all-action philosophy, injecting themselves into every opportunity regardless of competitive timeline. This spirited, somewhat chaotic identity has made the Blowers one of the most entertaining franchises to follow in the House of Commons Conference."

Thunder Bay takes an analytical and calculated approach to roster construction, making quiet moves in the off-season that work toward a clear long-term vision. The Mustangs rarely make win-now pushes, instead preferring to preserve core talent and roster flexibility for sustained competitiveness.
